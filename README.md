# 🚀 AWS Serverless Deployment

This repository demonstrates how to deploy a serverless application on AWS using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and other AWS services. The goal is to create a scalable and cost-efficient backend without managing servers.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications without worrying about server management. This project provides a hands-on example of deploying a serverless application on AWS, leveraging key services like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.

### 🔧 Features

- **AWS Lambda:** Handle backend logic without server management.
- **API Gateway:** Expose RESTful APIs to interact with the Lambda functions.
- **DynamoDB:** Store and retrieve data in a scalable NoSQL database.
- **S3:** Serve static content and store files.
- **IAM Roles:** Securely manage permissions for different AWS services.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/harsh20wardhan/aws_serverless_deployment.git
cd aws_serverless_deployment
\`\`\`

### 2. Set up AWS CLI

Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the appropriate credentials.

### 3. Deploy the application

Use the AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) CLI or the AWS Management Console to deploy the application:

\`\`\`bash
sam deploy --guided
\`\`\`

Follow the prompts to configure the deployment, including stack name, region, and other parameters.

## ⚙️ Usage

- **API Endpoints:** After deployment, you can interact with the application via the API Gateway endpoints.
- **Logs and Monitoring:** Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor logs and performance metrics.
